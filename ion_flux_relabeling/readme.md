## Ion Flux Relabeling
The gist of this challenge was given a perfect binary tree of a certain height and a node in that tree, find that node's parent.

1. Height was constrained to be from 1 to 30,
2. For a node without a parent, return -1, and
3. Return the anwer in a list form.

The height of the nodes present memory problems if you try to write out the entire tree, so it's best to merely walk down the tree and keep only what you need in memory.
